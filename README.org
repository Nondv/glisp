* glisp - PoC lisp in Golang

Based on a [[https://gist.github.com/Nondv/1dddf200d5d4f7c98be6917165c524b0][stupid-lisp PoC]] I've written a while ago. Inspired by LISP-1.5 (see
[[https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf][LISP 1.5 Programmer's Manual]] by McCarthy) and [[https://picolisp.com][PicoLisp]].

Was mainly developed to practice Golang

* Usage

#+begin_src bash
go build
./glisp yourcode.lisp
#+end_src

* Features

** Golang-embeddable and extendable
The interpreter simply needs a =Bindigings= list which can be extended with
native functions via =BuildNativeFn=.

** Code is /actually/ data

Every function is simply a list starting with =lambda= symbol (or a native
function which is bound directly from Golang).

This means that non-native functions can be inspected as lists and even modified
(although not sure why you'd want that).

Also the way a lambda is invoked is its parameters are passed to it
*unevaluated*. Consider this:

#+begin_src lisp
  (let ((inc (lambda ARG
               (+ ARG 1))))
    (inc 122))
#+end_src

This will throw an error as ARG will be simply =(x)= which isn't even an
integer.

In order to make this work, we need to evaluate the arguments explicitly:


#+begin_src lisp
  (let ((inc (lambda ARG
               (let ((first-arg (eval (car ARG))))
                 (+ first-arg 1)))))
    (inc 122))
#+end_src

or implicitly (which is how you'd expect a lambda to work):

#+begin_src lisp
  (let ((inc (lambda (x)
               (+ x 1))))
    (inc 122))
#+end_src


This feature has some interesting consequences:

- *No macros needed*. Macros are basically lisp functions that are called at
  compile time and they work with their arguments unevaluated. This is a
  completely different plane of execution. "Code is data" is a bit of a buzzword
  at this point because in modern lisps it really isn't (only at compile time).
- *Quote* isn't special. =(let ((quote (lambda ARG (car ARG)))) (quote a ignored))=
- *Dynamic binding*. Since code is actually data, it means binding has to happen
  at the moment of evaluation which may be in entirely different context from
  where the function was created. While dynamic binding isn't popular (only
  emacs and bash/etc come to mind from popular software), it does have some fun
  properties. Read some PicoLisp docs to learn more.
- *Symbolic programming* ?

** No special literals except =()=

In lisps usually you expect to see =nil= and =t=. This lisp doesn't treat them
any special way and instead simply treats =()= as empty list. =nil= and =t= can
be bound manually to =()= and =(quote t)= respectively.

* Examples
** =mapcar= and =list=
#+begin_src lisp
  (let ((quote (lambda ARG (car ARG)))
        (not (lambda (x) (if x () (quote true))))
        (mapcar (lambda (f lst)
                  (if (not lst)
                      lst
                      (cons (f (car lst)) (mapcar f (cdr lst))))))
        (list (lambda ARG
                (mapcar eval ARG))))
    (list 1 2 (list 4 5) list))

  ;; ==> (1 2 (4 5) (lambda ARG (mapcar eval ARG)))
#+end_src

** =reduce=, =push-last=, and =->>= (pipeline operator)

#+begin_src lisp
  ;; depends on: not, list

  (define reduce
          (lambda (initial-value f lst)
            (if (not lst)
                initial-value
                (reduce (f initial-value (car lst)) f (cdr lst)))))

  (define push-last
          (lambda (x lst)
            (cons (car lst)
                  (if (cdr lst)
                      (push-last x (cdr lst))
                      (list x)))))

  (define ->>
          (lambda ->>ARGS
            (eval (reduce (car ->>ARGS)
                          push-last
                          (cdr ->>ARGS)))))
  (->> 100
       (+ 20)
       (+ 3)
       (list)
       (push-last 456))

  ;; ==> (123 456)
#+end_src

** "Libraries"
#+begin_src lisp
  (load "lang/core.lisp")

  (->> 100
       (+ 20)
       (+ 3)
       (list)
       (push-last 456)
       (print))

  ;; ==> (123 456)
#+end_src

* Unfinished business
- Errors from lisp
- Better string escaping. Currently, only =\"= is supported and there's no way
  to provide =\"= as actual part of a string
- =format= function to output text (=print= provides =read=-able output, which
  is different).
- floats
- arithmetic (currently, only =+= is implemented)
- Reader macros. It'd be nice to have stuff like ='a= work
